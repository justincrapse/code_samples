Since I have not done much in Pandas, I'll run through my current assignment and explain what I know and don't know.

Here is a sample of the data set and the code courera provided to load it in, along with my comments. there are about 150 entries in this set.

first we read in the csv, ignoring the first row and using the first column as the index column, which is the country in this case
Next, the code loops through some matched columns and changes them; "inplace=True" means we are altering the original dataframe in-line
Names are set, which have not been covered yet. The column 'Totals' is dropped.

Question 1
Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?

"""
Not sure if this is the best way to do it, but it worked. I believe it works because you can do operations on the Series
in a dataframe and it will return the new data in a dataframe matched with the index intact. Then just call idxmax() to get
the index of the highest value after the operation

Question 3

relative to their total gold medal count? Summer Gold âˆ’ Winter Gold / Total Gold. Only include countries that 
have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.

First is the calulation we were asked to do. Then we filter out 'Gold' and 'Gold.1' values that are not greater 
than 0 as required. Lastly, we get the max as we have done before.

"""
Question 4
Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (Gold.2) 
counts for 3 points, silver medals (Silver.2) for 2 points, and bronze medals (Bronze.2) for 1 point. The function
should return only the column (a Series object) which you created.

Question 5
Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for 
future questions too...)

census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50].groupby('STNAME')['CTYNAME'].count().idxmax()
"""
first we make sure we do not include county values equal to the state, where a sum of all county populations 
are held. Next we group by 'STNAME', which will include all the counties for that state. Then we get the count 
of how many rows are in each group and return the index of the max.

Question 6
Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state, what are the three most populous states

I had this figured out except for the apply function, which I had not know about yet and found this part of the solution on the internet.  
I think the apply() and nlargest() functions are self explanatory. Verry useful.
