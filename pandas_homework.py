first we read in the csv, ignoring the first row and using the first column as the index column, which is the country in this case
Next, the code loops through some matched columns and changes them; "inplace=True" means we are altering the original dataframe in-line

Not sure if this is the best way to do it, but it worked. I believe it works because you can do operations on the Series
in a dataframe and it will return the new data in a dataframe matched with the index intact. Then just call idxmax() to get
the index of the highest value after the operation

Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (Gold.2)

should return only the column (a Series object) which you created.
